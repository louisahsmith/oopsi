Functions necessary to run the fast-oopsi algorithm in R
Based on the Python implementation of the fast-oopsi algorithm
by liubenyuan (https://github.com/liubenyuan/py-oopsi),
which is a port from the matlab code by jovo (https://github.com/jovo/oopsi),
the original developer of the algorithm (http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/375440972.html?FMT=ABS)
